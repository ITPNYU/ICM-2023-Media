# Pixels: Manipulating Pixel Data

*The videos in this section were created using a different editor for p5.js. All of the concepts should still apply, however, there are some minor changes. Most notably in JavaScript `let` is now the preferred way to declare a variable over `var`. If you would like to learn more about this you can [watch this video about let vs var](https://youtu.be/q8SHaDQdul0).*
