# Introduction to ICM: Media

### Question

Why are we interested in computing media?

# Pixels: Pixels as Data

_Some of the videos in this section were created using a different editor for p5.js. All of the concepts should still apply, however, there are some minor changes. Most notably in JavaScript `let` is now the preferred way to declare a variable over `var`. If you would like to learn more about this you can [watch this video about let vs var](https://youtu.be/q8SHaDQdul0)._

### Question

What can we express through algorithms?

- [11.3: The Pixel Array](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/pixels/more-p5/pixel-array)

#### Ways to play with pixels

- [11.4: Brightness Mirror](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/pixels/pixels/brightness-mirror)
- [11.5: Checkbox Mirror](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/pixels/pixels/checkbox-mirror)
- [11.6: Painting with Pixels](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/pixels/pixels/painting-with-pixels)â€”The particle objects in this video are using an older syntax for JavaScript that is different from classes. [The accompanying code example is updated with a Particle class](https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/sketches/0tRpxGdaq).
